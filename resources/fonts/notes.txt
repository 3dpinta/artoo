The following files were removed from this directory for licensing reasons:

Copenhagen_Light.otf
HelveticaNeue.dfont
HelveticaNeueLTPro-Lt.otf
HelveticaNeueLTPro-Roman.otf
HelveticaNeueMedium.ttf

.dfont files are sometimes an archive of several different variants of .ttf files

by default, PIL just uses the first, and doesn't provide a way to specify which one to use.
http://fondu.sourceforge.net/ is a tool that extracts each of them into individual .ttf files (install on OS X via `brew install fondu`).

This was used to generate HelveticaNeueMedium.ttf from HelveticaNeue.dfont
